# README


This app built using react is a one stop medical app for anyone that is on any type of medication whether prescribed or over the counter. It will have two models, a prescription model and a doctor model. Based on the input in the prescription model, the app will alert users when it is time to take their medication. It will also allow users to send SMS messages to their doctor in case they are experiencing any unexpected side effects or have  general questions about their medication. I will be using Ruby on rails for the database and server-side functionality, Twilio for the SMS messaging and I will also incorporate an authentication component.
