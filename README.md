# README


This app built using react is a one stop medical app for anyone that is taking any type of medication whether prescribed or over the counter. I will have two models, a prescription model and a doctor model. Based on the input in the prescription model, the app will alert users when it is time to take their medication. I will also allow users to send SMS messages to their doctor in case they are experiencing any unexpected side effects or have any general questions about their medication. I will be using Ruby on rails for the database and server-side functionality, Twilio for the sms messaging and I will also incorporate an authentication component.
