Goodrx
This react app is a one stop medical app for anyone that is taking any type of medication whether prescribed or over the counter. I will have two models, a prescription model and a doctor model. Based on the input in the prescription model, the app will alert them when it is time to take their medication. I will also allow them to send SMS messages to their doctor in case they are having any side effects or have any questions about their medication. I will be using Ruby on rails for the back-end, the sms messaging system twilio and I will be incorporating an authentication component.
