## Project Description
I am going to be building a  medical app for people on prescription and non prescription medications. I will have two models, a prescription model and a doctor model. Based on the input in the prescription model, the app will alert people when it is time to take their medicationss. I will also allow them to send SMS messages to their doctor, in case they are having any side effects or have any questions about their medication. I will be using Ruby on rails for the back-end,  twillow for sms. I will also have authentication.
